# Chapter 2
## Terraform Basics

???
**Now that you have terraform installed and working with AWS, we can do a few dry runs before building real infrastructure. Follow along carefully, copying and pasting the commands on each slide into your terminal as we go.**

# What is Terraform?
![Terraform](images/ch02/Terraform_VerticalLogo_FullColor.png)

Terraform is an open source provisioning tool.

It ships as a single binary which is written in Go. Terraform is cross platform and can run on Linux, Windows, or MacOS.

Installing terraform is easy. You simply download a zip file, unzip it, and run it.

# Terraform Command Line
Terraform is a command line tool.

Terraform commands are either typed in manually or run automatically from a script.

The commands are the same whether you are on Linux or Windows or MacOS.

Terraform has subcommands that perform different actions.

```terraform
# Basic Terraform Commands
terraform version
terraform help
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform destroy
```

---
name: terraform-help
# Terraform Help
```tex
*$ terraform help
Usage: terraform [-version] [-help] <command> [args]
...
Common commands:
    apply              Builds or changes infrastructure
    console            Interactive console for Terraform interpolations
    destroy            Destroy Terraform-managed infrastructure
    env                Workspace management
    fmt                Rewrites config files to canonical format
    graph              Create a visual graph of Terraform resources
```
Type `terraform subcommand help` to view help on a particular subcommand.
???
**This is a good command to know. Terraform help will reveal all the available subcommands.**

# Terraform Code
```terraform
resource aws_vpc "main" {
  cidr_block       = "10.0.0.0/16"
  instance_tenancy = "dedicated"
}
```

Terraform code is based on the [HCL2 toolkit](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl2). HCL stands for HashiCorp Configuration Language.

Terraform code, or simply *terraform* is a declarative language that is specifically designed for provisioning infrastructure on any cloud or platform.

---
name: main.tf
# Terraform Comments
Line Comments begin with an octothorpe<sup>*</sup>, or pound symbol: #
```hcl
# This is a line comment.
```

Block comments are contained between /\* and \*/ symbols.
```tex
/* This is a block comment.
Block comments can span multiple lines.
The comment ends with this symbol: */
```
.small[
\* Yes, it really is called an [octothorpe](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/octothorpe).

name: terraform-workspaces
# Terraform Workspaces

A terraform workspace is simply a folder or directory that contains terraform code.

Terraform files always end in either a `*.tf` or `*.tfvars` extension.

Most terraform workspaces contain a minimum of three files:

**main.tf** - Most of your functional code will go here.<br>
**variables.tf** - This file is for storing variables.<br>
**outputs.tf** - Define what is shown at the end of a terraform run.<br>

---
name: terraform-init
# Terraform Init
```tex
*$ terraform init

Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins...
- Downloading plugin for provider "aws" (hashicorp/aws) 2.35.0...
...
 provider.aws: version = "~> 2.35"

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

```
Terraform fetches any required providers and modules and stores them in the .terraform directory. If you add, change or update your modules or providers you will need to run init again.

???
**Terraform has an extendible architecture. You download the core program, terraform, then it fetches plugins and modules that are required for your code.**

---
name: terraform-plan
# Terraform Plan
```tex
*$ terraform plan
An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Terraform will perform the following actions:
  # aws_vpc.main will be created
  + resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
      + arn                              = (known after apply)
      + cidr_block                       = "10.0.0.0/16"
      ...
      + instance_tenancy                 = "dedicated"
    }
```
Preview your changes with `terraform plan` before you apply them.

???
**`terraform plan` is a dry run command. We're not actually building anything yet, Terraform is just telling is what it would do if we ran it for real.**

---
name: defining-variables
# Where are Variables Defined?
Terraform variables are placed in a file called *variables.tf*. Variables can have default settings. If you omit the default, the user will be prompted to enter a value. Here we are *declaring* the variables that we intend to use.

```tex
variable "prefix" {
  description = "This prefix will be included in the name of most resources."
}

variable "instance_tenancy" {
  description = "A tenancy option for instances launched into the VPC."
* default     = "dedicated"
}
```

???
**If you're curious where all these variables are defined, you can see them all in the _variables.tf_ file. Here we are simply defining all the available settings, and optionally declaring some default values. These defaults are what terraform will use if your user doesn't override them with their own settings.**

Q. Where could you override these defaults?<br>
A. In the terraform.tfvars file, or optionally on the command line or via environment variables. The most common approach is to use a tfvars file.

---
name: setting-variables
class: col-2
# How are Variables Set?
Once you have some variables defined, you can set and override them in different ways. Here is the level of precedence for each method.

This list goes from highest precedence (1) to lowest (5).

<br>
```tex
1. Command line flag - run as a
   command line switch
2. Configuration file - set in
   your terraform.tfvars file
3. Environment variable - part of
   your shell environment
4. Default Config - default value
   in variables.tf
5. User manual entry - if not
   specified, prompt the user
   for entry
```
