# Using Terraform Provisioners
Once you've used Terraform to stand up a virtual machine or container, you may wish to configure your operating system and applications. This is where provisioners come in. Terraform supports several different types of provisioners including: Bash, Powershell, Chef, Puppet, Ansible, and more.

.center[https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/index.html]

???
**Terraform works hand-in-hand with these other configuration management tools to install packages, configure applications and change OS settings inside of a virtual machine or container.**

# The File Provisioner
The Terraform file provisioner copies files onto the remote machine.

```terraform
provisioner "file" {
  source        = "files/"
  destination   = "/home/${var.admin_username}/"

  connection {
    type        = "ssh"
    user        = var.username
    private_key = file(var.ssh_key)
    host        = ${self.ip}
  }
}
```

Note the *connection* block of code inside the provisioner block. The file provisioner supports both SSH and WinRM connections.

???
SSH for linux, WinRM for your windows machines.

class: compact
# The Remote Exec Provisioner
The remote exec provisioner allows you to execute scripts or other programs on the target host. If it's something you can run unattended (for example, a software installer), then you can run it with remote exec.

```terraform
provisioner "remote-exec" {
  inline = [
    "sudo chown -R ${var.admin_username}:${var.admin_username} /var/www/html",
    "chmod +x *.sh",
    "PLACEHOLDER=${var.placeholder} WIDTH=${var.width} HEIGHT=${var.height} PREFIX=${var.prefix} ./deploy_app.sh",
  ]
...
}
```

In this example we're running a few commands to change some permissions and ownership, and to run a script with some enviroment variables.

???
Local exec and remote exec can be used to trigger Puppet or Ansible runs. We do have a dedicated chef provisioner as well.

Terraform works well with common config management tools like Chef, Puppet or Ansible.

# Terraform Provisioner Tips
Terraform provisioners like remote-exec are great when you need to run a few simple commands or scripts. For more complex configuration management you'll want a tool like Chef or Ansible.

Provisioners only run the first time a Terraform run is executed. In this sense, they are not idempotent. If you need ongoing state management of VMs or servers that are long-lived, we recommend using a config management tool.

On the other hand, if you want immutable infrastructure you should consider using our [Packer](https://packer.io) tool.

# üë©‚Äçüíª Lab Exercise: Provisioners, Variables and Outputs
In part two of the lab we'll use a provisioner to install a new software package. We will also explore variables and outputs.

Return to the training lab and continue where you left off.

üõë **STOP** after you complete the fourth quiz.
