# Terraform State
Terraform is a _stateful_ application. This means that it keeps track of everything you build inside of a **state file**. You may have noticed the terraform.tfstate and terraform.tfstate.backup files that appeared inside your working directory.

The state file is Terraform's source of record for everything it knows about.

```json
{
  "version": 4,
  "terraform_version": "0.12.7",
  "serial": 14,
  "lineage": "452b4191-89f6-db17-a3b1-4470dcb00607",
  "outputs": {
    "catapp_url": {
      "value": "http://go-hashicat-5c0265179ccda553.workshop.aws.hashidemos.io",
      "type": "string"
    },
```

Sometimes infrastructure may be changed outside of Terraform's control.

The state file represents the *last known* state of the infrastructure. If you'd like to check and see if the state file still matches what you built, you can use the **terraform refresh** command.

Note that this does *not* update your infrastructure, it simply updates the state file.

```bash
terraform refresh
```

# Changing Existing Infrastructure

Whenever you run a plan or apply, Terraform reconciles three different data sources:

1.  What you wrote in your code
2.  The state file
3.  What actually exists

Terraform does its best to add, delete, change, or replace existing resources based on what is in your *.tf files. Here are the four different things that can happen to each resource during a plan/apply:

```tex
+   create
-   destroy
-/+ replace
~   update in-place
```
